That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
Oh, oh Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again? She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core

I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me

Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam.
I ain't lost, just wandering" Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls to me
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
That was what you told me I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I was too strong you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising), umm
Baby I'm so rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down), umm
There's only one way down I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We've both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all, with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you
Love to you, ooh baby
Love to you, yeah All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing you can't do
But keep me making love to me
Love to me, ooh baby
Love to you, yeah And I can tell by the way you walk that walk
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do is make your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just want to make love to you
Love to you, ooh yeah
Love to you, yeah And I can tell by the way you walk that walk
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk

Oh I just want to make love to you Happy New Year! Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head Lay down with me
And tell me no lies
Just hold me closly
Don't patronize Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, yeah I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight And I will give up this fight 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, ooh don't
You, when you don't, yeah, yeah Hold me closer, one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me, for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face, under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart, more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better for you This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall
at sky fall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me with out the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand.... Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall (Verse 1)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)
Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all
Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
We could've had it all... We could've had it all...
It all, It all, It all... We could've had it all...
Rollin' in the deep...
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,
They don't know you like I do,
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time,
It drags, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
If this is ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion [Verse 1]
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl

In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me there's (Something), something, something about this place
(Something), something about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about baby you and I It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me there's (Something), something, something about this place

There's only three men that I am a certain my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ (Something), something, something about the chase (six whole years)
I am a New York woman born to rock you down
So want my lipstick all over your face

Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you We are the crowd
We're c-coming out
Got my flash on it's true

We'd be so fantastical Leather and jeans
We're rock glamorous
Not sure what it means

You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons

Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one

Last night when we were alone
You threw your arms up
Baby you gave up, you gave up I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke? I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
All my bubble dreams, bubble dreams I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love
So baby raise a glass to mend
All the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless I'll never love again
Oh friend you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless How? Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow
Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up?
Could I give it all up for you? And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up? If I promised boy to you
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again How, how, how so speechless
You left me speechless, so speechless baby Will you ever talk again?
Oh boy, why you so speechless?
You've left me speechless, so speechless Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"
Why you so speechless? Oh oh oh I'll undress you, 'cause you're tired
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want, it's in my arms So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything

(Last night) Our lovers quarrel (I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say (And it was kind of dirty)
Oh my (And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here! (It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here! (It was kind of trashy)
Cause I can't help my mind from going there! [Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you [Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (don't stop the party)
Making love in my sex dreams (4x) [Verse 2]
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought (cause I'm broken)
Let's white- (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here!
(And I feel so trashy)
Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads! [Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you [Chorus 2]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my Sexxx dreams
Don't stop the party (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, Tomorrow when I run into you [Bridge]
You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him [Speaking]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks
And oh my god
(*vomits and giggles*) [Chorus 3]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)
Last night
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my Sexxx dreams) [iTunes Festival Bridge]
We were in the swimming pool. I was naked, so were you, and I wrote this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies and now's the time for the trial with doubts and drawls
(I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple of drinks and, oh my god-- [laughs]) Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick I wanna kiss you
But if I do then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A love game, a love game Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds isn't enough
For my heart to quit it Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest, I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A love game, a love game Hold me and love me
Just want touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds isn't enough
For my heart to quit it Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
'Cause I'm a wandering man, he said to me And what about our future plans?
Does it seem we have even make sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me So I said, "I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight, tonight" So I just packed my baggage and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took the road to nowhere on my own Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home And I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see world together
I don't wanna be alone forever

A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy, I'm And then he asked me,
Said, "Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple.
It's the way that you love and treat your mother" Thought that I would be alone forever
But I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home
But I think with you I can spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life Would you go with me?
(For life)
See the world with me 'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion) (Where are you, 'cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion (but I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy)
(Where are you, 'cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me)
Illusion (but I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love (where are you 'cause I can't see)

Mistaken for love (dilated, falling free in a modern ecstasy)
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy I'm over the show

It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love

You were so perfect
You were a, you were a perfect illusion It's like, I just love a cowboy you know
I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad
But I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?! Three am, Mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
One, two ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne So I go to the eye
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne Last night

It was kind of nasty
(Help me here)
It was kind of trashy
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place

When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)

Hey yo You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still

Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay Young, wild, American

And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright Just give in don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me Just know when that glass is empty

Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way saying forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For something he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothing more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece from Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for getting what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold (Verse 1:)
Hey babe,

You see I

I'm looking for someone that can handle me.
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so.

You and me were kind of in complete.
Need someone to say me he loveth me. Give it up
Put it up

Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
I'm laying down on famous knives so everybody sees Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I know could love and save me from myself
But maybe I'll just clean the shit off these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you VERSE:
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel
But was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool
So everybody sees Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Maybe someone I love could save me from myself
Or maybe I'll just clean the shit off these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you CHORUS:
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note POST-CHORUS:
Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die

We want to watch her cry
Princess die REPEAT CHORUS BRIDGE:
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriends limo

Because I lost my only friend
God forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
Oh I will hate myself until I die My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low, from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and
Twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low, from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope [Verse 1]
I always thought it was you,
You always thought it was me.
We always thought we were it,
Seemed like a real perfect fit,
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free. I always thought even though,
We were so young we could grow.
Up in the end it'd be us,
We'd take the F or the bus,
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free. [Chorus]
Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Verse 2]
I miss our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV,
The one where the Russian scored,
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair. I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open our last beer,
Falling asleep in our tears,
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free. [Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you
I'ts not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Bridge]
I found an old pair of
Keys in my purse that opened
The lockup we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there
I wanna make it work. I didn't brush my hair
And my lashes are falling
Off of seven years
Of our bad luck dating.
I want one last night there,
A Brooklyn Night affair. [Chorus]
Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Outro]
Its not that I don't want to love you
Cause I really tried, and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu Huh oh
Yeah yeah
Huh oh
Whoa woa
Oh I
I feel good
I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall, I
I stand up
And then I'm OK
But then you print some shit that makes me want to scream So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me

And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body

Do what you want with my body Come to me, in all your glamour, and cruelty
Just do the thing that you do
And I'll undress you Give it tight, sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you? A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My artpop could mean anything [Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP Come to me, without your sub-techs and fantasy
Just do the thing that you do
For my love is you Love is fly, I've flown my beaches with lover's side
The color's palette you choose
Can profit you A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My artpop could mean anything Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
my artpop could mean anything [Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP [Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP Brushes with darkness wont help you create
your destiny of self but Artpop could mean anything
Anything
I tried to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music not the bling
Music not the bling [Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP
[Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)

Downtown Just another way to prove I love you and it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say that makes me mad
I'll turn away, I'll turn away, I'll turn away And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyous thoughts We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey, I love you
And after all, it's just another day Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts, I'll laugh in humble ways We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all, it's just another day Come on, Mark Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all, it's just another day And after all it's just another day Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand
Dink in link in, sand-script with a fan
Remembering me, before it began
Sometimes I felt so def in a jam
But the ones who loved me, told me to stop
Like home girl can't catch shit if it drops
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man 'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Wont sign no monkey papers

Babe Last time I thought we had this talk
Boy you were getting ready to leave
I thought that baby you were done
Cause for a while you could barely look at me This time I thought that we`d be fine
That I`d forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words But baby you can not forget the past
Oh oh oh oh babe
Can not forget the past
Oh oh oh oh, Still baby (Babe) I'm so unpredictable
you don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder
the second time around the second time around We tried going back to Joe's
That always was our favorite place
Long rides baby by the coast

Oh oh oh oh babe

Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder
the second time around I`m not sure the best of way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more babe
This ferris wheel`s got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us babe
Not meant for us babe hey-yeah! I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think

There's a change I'm here to see
I walk alone on a lonely road
I've many wonders to believe You can try to hear the talk
Or selling out a masterpiece
You've got a trunk full of gold
I've got someone to believe This ain't about Kings or Queens
Ain't about You and Me.
Do you need a dose of truth?
What am I supposed to do? How can you deal with it (With it)
Do you just avoid the guilt
Something you gotta I know,
If you can deal with me,
Shut your mouth, sip on that TEA! It's been so long
Since I've had a sip and I get this feeling
I need a green detox
The truth will be the winner tonight Red one lady gaga haha baby baby baby baby i anit gonna runaway runaway run run run run away

Stickss and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me.

Who's that chick? who's that chick? The hills are alive,
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years The hills fill my heart,
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark
Who is learning to pray I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before
My heart will be blessed,
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad Edelweiss,Edelweiss
Bless my homeland forever. Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
Till you find your dream A dream that will need
All the love you can give
Everyday of your life
For as long as you live Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
Till you find your dream I am so fab

About a million reasons If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down Put some lipstick on

My furs is Mongolian my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows hes so fucking gifted

Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child Im fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking
Colin Powells Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obamas nation

Six thousand dollar pair of shoes we made it to the Paris news
Dont talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me fore I embarrass you

I believe theres a God above me

New God Flow fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer write it in bold letters
They love a niggas spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha aint fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay as a wholesaler
I think its good that Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him

Matchin Daytonas rose gold on us
Goin H¬∑A¬∑M in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it Ima pour more

Til we drown all these haters rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars money girls and the clothes

Picture workin so hard and you cant cut through
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to Im from the
Where cops dont come through and dreams dont come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From workin McDonalds barely payin the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
killings in a weekend killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
In Jesus name let the choir say

And well annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know they admire Ye
Ello ello ello hello white America assassinate my character
Money matrimony yeah they tryna break the marriage up

On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint your right girl
Youll probably find one of them I like arttype girls
All of the lights shewascaughtinthehype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely Chloe Mitchell
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit thats the tea no sip
Dont trip dont trip that pussy slippery no whip
We aint trippin on shit we just sippin on this
Just forget the whole shit we could laugh about nothin
I impregnate your mind lets have a baby without fuckin yo
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin
Thuggin hustlin before you met your husband
Then I said What if Mary was in the club
Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs
Cover Nori in lambs wool
We surrounded by the fuckin wolves
What if Mary What if Mary
Was in the club was in the club
Fore she met Joseph with no love
Cover Saint in lambs wool
And she was We surrounded by
Surrounded by the fuckin wolves‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Ive given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
See before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You aint never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times just to say dont text me hoe
Told you four times dont test me hoe
Now we finna lose all selfcontrol
But you aint finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But Imma have the last laugh in the end
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah Imma have to laugh Indian
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
And I
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I dont know what it is with females
But Im not too good with that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know thats what Im good at
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I dont know how Imma manage
If one day you just up and leave
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God Id be back in a second
Man its so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
My Momma couldnt get through to me
The drama people suing me
Im on TV talking like its just you and me
Im just saying how I feel man
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hillman
I guess the money shouldve changed him
I guess I shouldve forgot where I came from
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldnt tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started hours ago oh am I late
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Let me know if its a problem then aight man holla then
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He dont even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
Must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure whats your pleasure
Life is a UH depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada Adam Eve wear nada
Im in between but way more fresher
With way less effort cause when you try hard
Thats when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you my God

Step up in this bitch like turn me up
Im the one your bitch like
Yeah Im the one your bitch like
And I be talkin shit like
I aint scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin on my dick like
She wanna see if itll fit right
Thats just the wave
Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Even when somebody go away turn me up
The feelings dont really go away
Thats just the wave yeah
I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
Mercy mercy me that Murcielago
Thats me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato
You aint got no Yeezy nigga
Stupid but what the hell do I know

And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that its random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said ‚Äútake them glasses off and get in the pool‚Äù
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach

My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes

You blowin up thats good fantastic

Eighteen years eighteen years
She got one of your kids got you for eighteen years
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids

And when you get on hell leave your ass for a white girl
May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole I guess its rubbing off
Hood phenomenon the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime
When the sun go down its the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat

I used the Western Union for you like its no prob
Cause you was in college complainin about its no jobs
But you were suckin a nigga dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjobs better than no job
This the crayist shit in the club
Since In Da Club
Its so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguards back like Prince in the club
She say Can you get my friends in the club
I say Can you get my Benz in the club
If not treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside til the evenin end
When I go raw I like to leave it in
When I wake up I like to go again
When I go to work she gotta call it in
She cant go to work same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin close to him
Yeezus just rose again
I drink a Boost for breakfast an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry Mr HtotheIzzos back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her sons on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal shed been trying to be mine
She a Delta so shed been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin I been tryin to be signed
Tryin to be a millionaire how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots but I aint Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I aint trying to make a band
I swear this right here history in the making man
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around
But he wasnt talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except hes really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude bad night right place wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I aint too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God Driver wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe safe
My dawgs couldnt tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
It was televised
Theres been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable what you thought theyd call me Mr Glass
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up Im a grownass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But Im a champion so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music thats fire spit my soul through the wire
Lets get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary Im the boss tonight
And you dont give a fuck what they all say right
Awesome the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn they dont make em like this anymore
I ask cause Im not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead go nuts go apeshit
Specially in my Pastel on my Bape shit
Act like you cant tell who made this
New Gospel homie take six and take this haters
I dont know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
Im trippin this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me
Theres a thousand yous theres only one of me
Im trippin Im caught up in the moment right
Cause its Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon do everything that Kan like
Heard theyd do anything for a Klondike
Well Id do anything for a blonde dyke
And shell do anything for the limelight
And well do anything when the times right
Uh baby youre makin it
Harder better faster stronger
Damn baby pussy cant be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically Russell aint the only Russell
Russell Brand Russell Crowe
Zero Zero Zero Zero a whole lot of Os
What you after actor money
You in line behind currency yeah you after money
Bullet proof condom when Im in these hoes

And I swear to God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes

She got her fur too we got our his and her on
Dont look at the jewelry or get your burrr on
Too close you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back you overclose
Oh no the hood was strugglin
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and Im cold bitch please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
She dont believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the stores departments
You more like love to start shit
Im more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors doeuvres views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why cant life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like Where are you Yeezy
And try to hit you with the olwuwopte
Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
I know its been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
Itll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past you on the other side of the glass
Of my memorys museum
Im just saying hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you cant roam without Caesar
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JayZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant Can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Oh my god is that a black card
I turned around and replied Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their hat
Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking bout me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talking bout ChiTown
It was all good just a week ago niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon do Hov
This a new crack on a new stove
Im in the twodoor true that niggas telling me You back
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch huh
And if lifes a bitch bet she suck my dick huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique huh
By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga
Just forget it you talk it I live it
Like Eli I did it jokes on you motherfucker and I get it
No paper ho but you can have some more of me
Oragy or are we speaking metaphorically
Historically Im kicking bitches out like Pam nigga
Going H¬∑A¬∑M nigga
Me and Jigga
And a nigga still young thats why I have no kids
But Ive been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls asses flat as shit
But the heads so good damn a nigga glad he hit
Got em jumping out the building watch out below
A million out the door Im about to go H¬∑A¬∑M
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more Os
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
Its cause I was too busy with my Baltimore you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you falling for the clothes
Cars money girls and the clothes
Aw money you sold your soul
Nah man mad people was fronting
Goddamn we made something from nothing
Youre my devil youre my angel
Youre my heaven youre my hell
Youre my now youre my forever
Youre my freedom youre my jail
Youre my lies youre my truth
Youre my war youre my truce
Youre my questions youre my proof
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
Ma ma se ma ma se ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Lets break out of this fakeass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms still get laid yeah yeah yeah
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasnt supposed to make it past
Ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
But buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know he got a plan I know Im on your beams
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo

Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton

And next these niggas might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is

Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method

Jesus walks for them
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause were the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models we rap we dont think

Or here to convert atheists into believers
Im just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns sex lies videotape
But if I talk about God my record wont get played huh
Well if this take away from my spins
Whichll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that Im dreamin about
Next time Im in the club everybody screamin out
Wake up Mr West Mr West
Mr Fresh Mister by himself hes so impressed
I mean damn did you even see the test

Homie this shit is basic welcome to Graduation
Good morning on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
Im like the fly Malcolm X buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league from a eighth to a ki
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed now you doing your thang
Good morning look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world complacent career student
Some people graduate but be still stupid
They tell you read this eat this dont look around
Just peep this preachers teach us Jesus
Okay look up now they done stoled yo streetness
After all of that you received this
Im the one baby yeah Im the one baby
Since God gave his only begotten son baby

You think you me but you aint me what you done lately
Mhm thats cool but I been runnin on the sun baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
Thats my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson Jackson Jordan Michael Phelps

Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip Yeeeaaaalmmp
Welcome to the good life where niggas who sell D
Wont even get pulled over in they new V
The good life lets go on a living spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life it feel like Atlanta

Ah Now throw yo hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Yall pop the trunk I pop the hood Ferrari

And if they hate then let em hate and watch the money pile up
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane while gettin some brain
Whipped it out she said I never seen Snakes on a Plane
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin moneys not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst but when I get my card back
Activated Im back to Vegas
Cause the good life I always had a passion for flashin
Befo I had it I closed my eyes and imagined the good life
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the locks
Now lets go take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that UHaul van
Any pessimists I aint talk to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartament
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line Dawg in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dawg You where I am
A hiphop legend
I think I died in that accident cause this must be Heaven
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
Id do anything to say I got it
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Baby Im going on an aeroplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home thought I needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
Close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes well sort of I think em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn is he really that caught up
I ask if you talked about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Its for yourself thats important
If your stripper name Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me thats just the Henny man
I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I cant because
I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
minutes later sein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ARs lookin like Pssh we messed up
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Rrrrright here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least or times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout picture
Us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
round the same time of that Blueprint
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate espanol No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
And Ill never let my son have an ego
Hell be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And Ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
See I just want him to have an easy life
Not like Yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
Dont want him to be hated all the time judged
Dont be like your daddy that would never budge
And Ill never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
And Ill never let his mom move to LA
Knowin she couldnt take the pressure now we all pray
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake make a priest faint
Make a nun cum make her cremate
Move downtown cop a sweet space
Livin life like we won the sweepstakes what
We headed to hell for heavens sakes huh
Well Imma levitate make the devil wait yeah
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin from inside the screen you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal or do a gangbang
Its kinda crazy thats all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang
One day Im gon marry a porn star
Well have a bigass crib and a long yard
Well have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin to hide we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play til I roll over
Imma need a whole day at least rolled doja
What party is we goin to on Oscar day
specially if she cant get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her ‚ÄúGet away‚Äù
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on
Mmm aint this some shit Pulled up in the AVentador
And the doors raise up like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show and a tour and a movie and a score
This a ghetto opera Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques Rick Rossd told me that
Said Id be all up in Goldman Sachs like These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back Im just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney dont pay no tax Mitt Romney dont pay no tax
ChiTown til Im on my back ChiTown til Im on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills where the hell is Axel Foley at
Ease up there baby boy Ving Rhames told Jody that
R Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you holy crap
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and Im finna let it shine
Im finna take yall back to them better times
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
Seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Imma get you a Jag whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of SType Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama
And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
AllƒÅhu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Arent you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
Im just tryna be inside you fore you wake up
We had problems but its all in the past
Everybody got problems baby algebra class
Remember I used to do things thatd make you laugh
Like orderin a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like pi√±a coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Aint no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching youre pissed off tripping
Cause even when were kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like No he didnt
No he didnt is you talking about Kitten
Is that bitch still stripping
Trying to get a pair of Christians
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say How is work baby
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credits so bad I cant get no one to cosign
I wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
Now she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame its a miracle that shed
Talk to a nigga with a tenyear ago swag
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone hollin that niggas is whatever
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong except a nigga grown
So I cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
Thirty foot train diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides Im so glad you came
Aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
Wedding in June what could be better
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor Just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasnt excited
Well we gon tour the countryside and they wont be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private
Im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you aint told me
Ayo I did some things but thats the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you dont know me
You got a new friend well I got homies
But in the end its still so lonely
How could you be so Dr Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we wasnt gonna speak so
Why we up AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold
I wont stop wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that youre leavin me
They say that they dont see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months then you gonna see
Youll never find nobody better than me
You dont see just how wild the crowd is realize
You dont see just how fly my style is realize
I dont see why I need a stylist realize
When I shop so much I can speak Italian realize
I dont know I just want it better for my kids realize
And I aint saying we was from the projects realize

We was sort of like Will Smith and his son realize
In the movie I aint talking bout the rich ones realize
Cause every summer
Hell get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from realize
And I dont know what he did for dough realize
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe
When it feel like livings harder than dying realize
For me giving ups way harder than trying realize

I wish her heart still was in rhyming realize
Cause who the kids gon listen to huh realize
I guess me if it isnt you realize
Last week I paid a visit to the institute realize
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school realize

Drop gems like I dropped out of PE realize
They used to feel invisible realize
Now they know they invincible
I paid for them titties get your own
It aint safe in the city watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats she learning a new word its yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
Im a freak huh rock star life
The second girl with us thats our wife
Hey boys and girls I got a new riddle
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect Im not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle
Where she at In the middle
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyonc√©
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like WillIAm
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am
And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
Theyd rather give me the Nigga Please Award
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award
I know that people wouldnt usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year Chicago had over caskets
Man killings some wack shit
Oh I forgot cept for when niggas is rappin
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tithe so I cant afford to pay
Pink slip on my door cause I cant afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up but I got more to say
Thats enough Mr West please no more today
You sweat her and I aint talkin bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I aint talkin bout Cool J
See me at the airport at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay groupies say Im too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays I still have it my way
Yall dont want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
Ill show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin over babysitters like bitch its yo turn
Damn Ye itd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is superofficial
RRRRoc pastel with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride throw a movie on

Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on gone
Uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn
Uhuh onnn uh uhuh
Im ahead of my time sometimes years out
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
Yeah I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me Benz or Rover
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheapass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I cant believe it when I look up in the mirro
How we out in Europe spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
I know I got it I dont know what yall on
Ima open up a store for aspiring MCs
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Youll sell everything including the mannequin

Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
They said Sorry Mr West is gone
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said You going to school Ill give you a summer
Then she met No ID and gave me his number
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do Turn around gave them beats to Jay
And Im rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess Im getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folksll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes damn
South Park had them all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This aint no fashion show mothafucka we live it
Ive been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think Im never wrong
You know what maybe youre right aight
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It aint happen yet
And thats what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means
And Im back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And thats why Im
Seven oclock thats primetime
Heavenll watch God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
Im a star how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if youll ever find your dreams
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye lets put him all in the front of the store
So Im on break next to the No Smokin sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin my hits writing my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle
You cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doing beats a day for summers
Thats a Different World like Cree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
Im just waiting on my spaceship
Nnnnow my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets I got the bounce like hydraulics
I cant call it I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said Ise a loser I told her why dont you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me Im gonna follow
My heart and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You aint gotta guess whos back you see
Im so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastards flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I dont usually smoke
But pass the dro
And I wont give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool We assholes
Thats why we hear your music in fast forward
Cuz we dont wanna hear that weak shit no mo

Took nothin from no man man Im my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasnt broke man
Flickin Starter coats man
Man you dont know man
We dont care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
Cause this summer they aint finna say next summer Im finna
Sittin in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin man your ass is grown
The second verse is for my dogs workin to that still hustle
Cause a nigga cant shine off
And everybody sellin makeup Jacobs
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we dont care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Round the same time Doe ran up in dude house
Couldnt get a job so since he couldnt get work
He figured hed take work
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
A niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
But we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
And we dont care what people say
You know the kids gon act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS some of em dyslexic
They favorite Cent song Questions
We scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
We aint retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
Im tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we dont live here
Look what was handed us fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we dont care what people say
My niggas
This is family business
And this is for the family that cant be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down know the answers in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your grannys picture
Now that youre gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas this cant be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man This Cant Be Life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate soul food know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
And look tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
And if you did then thats family business
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on lets take a family Grammy picture

But I bet them Polaroidsll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie you dont mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you dont wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you aint took a bath with your cousins
Fit in the bed if its of yall
Im talkin bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin sun
All my niggas from the Chi thats my family dog
And my niggas aint my guys they my family dog
I feel like one day youll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin
Sittin here grillin people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin
The second she storm out then he storm in
Yall gon sit down have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isnt
We aint letting everybody in our family business
Yeah uh now Ima need you to kill the hypocrisy
This is an aristocracy

Immature adult insecure asshole
And if you fall on the concrete thats your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan beat thats your last fault
Get what you ask for I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low
Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin money they be all up on your ass yo
When you gettin money cops dont let a nigga pass Go
Straight to jail yo in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer tell em I said Hello
Ask if Ima be there soon and tell him I said ‚ÄúHell no‚Äù
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh
Pour the champagne let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now Im in the Louvre lookin for fossils
Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells its so unCamry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
Cute your shorty watch Barneys we head to Barneys
End up at Marni Giorgio service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year last year was magic
Lyrically cant none of yall murder Ye
Cause yall raps aint got no vertebrae
I got style ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris raised the murder rate
First of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majestys swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GDs but I am Lord
Rap god Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Heres somethin that you could use in analogy
My life is like a childs illusions become reality
Can I talk my shit again
Even if I dont hit again
Dog are you fucking kidding
My hat my shoes my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch with Donatella Versace
Thats Louis Vuitton bitch
I think Hennessy I drank Im gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona Im zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And Hey
Please dont start me
Im like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
Im pop the Barkers Im hood the Parkers
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
Im on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
Its easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And oh yeah Yeezy
I did it for the glory
What am I supposed to do now
Man the game all messed up
How Im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the night
The grind the empty bottles of NoDoz
Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you dont floss
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss
Why I gotta ask what that Tudor cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And Im asking about her girlfriends
Yeah the dark skined ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like
I know I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know BIG and Pac you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Any one Big Pun Big L or Notorious
Till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
I miss the misogyny bad bitches massagin me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please dont judge me uh for the followin
Fat bitches swallowin skinny bitches modelin
Take off that Givenchy and lets get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing cause when you chase the pussy its a sin
But if it falls in your lap its a blessin
Soon as I got salad I spent it all on dressin
French to be exact that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers
My homie Mali used to stay at th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin he was stuntin
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See backback thenthen if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
Wed take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Fuck all that flirtin Im tryin to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes homie
He told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie
I do it for the forefathers yeah the street authors
That are now ARs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now theres crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that wont make it to the family will
If I dont make it cant take it hope the family will
They aint crazy they dont know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so its not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
No electro no metro a little retro ahh perfecto
You know the demo your boy act wild
You aint get the memo Yeezys back in style
Now one room got Gidget the other got Bridget
Whats more tripped out dawg is they sisters
Nah you aint listen they black they sistas
They momma named them after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelrys Egyptian know the hungers Ethiopian
Stupid questions like ‚ÄúIs he gon be dope again
Have you seen him has anybody spoke to him‚Äù
This beat deserves Hennessey a bad bitch
And a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your lifes cursed well mines an obscenity

Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head stop breathe get up check your weave
Dont drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and dont disrespect your seed

Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss I forgot your name

Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
Twista said Get It Wet
Ooh girl your breath is harsh
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars

But I still mess with a big girl
If you aint fit girl Ill still hit girl

All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers gangstas all us ballas

But itd be wrong if I aint say nothin
Imagine if I aint say somethin
Wouldnt none these niggas say nothin

So I keep it low keep a secret code
So everybody else dont have to know
Im not loving you way I wanted to
I cant keep my cool so I keep it true
I got something to lose so I gotta move
I cant keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind when Im on my own
Somewhere far from home in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fore it finally got through
You lose you lose
Im not loving you the way I wanted to

But Im not loving you the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll only God knows
If I be with you baby Im confused
You choose you choose
Im not loving you way I wanted to
Where I wanna go I dont need you
Ive been down this road too many times before
Im not loving you way I wanted to

Her family cryin they want her to live and she tryin

And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandmas in the NBA

Was just a secretary worked for the church for years
Things sposed to stop right here

And Im doing pretty hood in my pink polo

And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top MCs you aint gotta remind me
Top MCs you gotta rewind me
Im high up on the line you could get behind me
But my heads so big you cant sit behind me
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
Id never do that to you at least purposely
We breaking up again we making up again
But we dont love no more I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
And you talk about her family her aunts and shit
And she say Motherfucker your mommas a bitch
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
Id never hit a girl but Ill shake the shit out of you
But Imma be the bigger man
Big pimpin like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure its
And my niggas said I shouldnt let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently
But I been thinkin and it got me back to sinkin
And this relationship it even got me back to drinkin
Now this Hennessy
Its gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that Id try you would question me
Saying You fucking them girls disrespecting me
You dont see how your lies is affecting me
You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone you always be where them hos will be
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car oh
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But I couldnt hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong
My godsister getting married by the lake
But I couldnt figure out who Id wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
Driving around town looking for the best spot
For the drunk and hot girls

Till you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
But sorry were closed
How we stop the Black Panthers
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that its like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it cut it measure it bag it
Sell it the fiends cop it nowadays they cant tell if
Thats that good shit we aint sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah thats pure man
From the place where the fathers gone the mothers is hardly home
And the Madigans lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say we just tryin to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood its a different type of chemical
Arm Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove cause
Cause dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
To bein the President look theres hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
and this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you round that
You cant buy this Superflyness like a shine is
Your Highness is performing look how long the line is
Its what happens when you make shit thats timeless
Its what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
Thats so novice Im so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasnt my place
The beats slow til you listen to my pace
Cause I be killing shit but thats evident
And yall feeling it but I expected it
If its classic its gon last forever then
Im everywhere you never been and better than I ever been
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
Thatd turn my life to Stephen Kings
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like Im on parole
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh
Just looking at your history
Youre like the girl from Misery
She said she aint take it to this degree
Well lets agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh
Golly more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to pologize to Mos and Kweli probably
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali Mali
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain Carti lens and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped Id say somethin significant
But now Im rappin bout money hoes and rims again
And its still about the Benjamins

Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
Whatcha gon buy next Whatever new trend it is

What the hell was wrong with me dog

Ladies tired of gettin ripped off by guys like this
And givin head is like a whale thats usin a toothpick
Well Im in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for free
Later on I might charge for menage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it aint gon cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And Im still actin calm denamuhh
She asked Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was
While we drive she tellin me bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin off dont get no rich nigga
Give ME some head thatll really piss him off

In the four dot six bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or til I go crash
Whatever comes first Im prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second Ill be there with my weapon
Pullin up in the Lexuses one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin me messages

You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds
Now Im in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muhfuckers underachievin
Man this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if Im too late for the intro

You can stop complainin cause Im finally here yeah
We gon to Mass today we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers dont even deserve a track from me
You see if you ever wanted to ever be anything
Thered always be somebody that shoot down any dream
Therell always be haters thats the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon have to take my life fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin thats what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind fore Im out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl dont like me how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say Yo no hablo ingl√©s
And everybody want to run to me for their single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldnt feel myself
Dawg if I was you Id kill myself
Made a mil myself and Im still myself
And Imma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now Ill speak from the heart yall all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least yall feel something
Such an easy morning we on a ride
And Im feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They dont want black people to think and drive
I mean my whole team bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that its Fashion Week
And the weather wasnt barely hot

Did I mention GOOD Music and forever we hot
Motherfucker are you ready or not
Merry Christmas to all and all a good night
Huh now we all livin the good life

And Im so happy Im with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin for the mall dont trip you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that ‚ÄúYou the star at the top of my Christmas tree‚Äù

And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie

Yep we was praticing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child cuz now yall
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But itll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man man I wouldnt let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life real life if you try to
So close so close but so far so far
And so far so far no cigar no cigar
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Imma live like its no tomorrow
No goodbyes
Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaias
When I met you I heard Jesus bells strings and the choir
I got lines thats better than niggas albums plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We aint dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
Im trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if Im a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if Im trapped by the boobies booby trapped
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe cause its flooded
Why you walk around with a baby crosss cousin
My teeth already white yall gon make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds whats the cause of the fronting
Why yall got all caps on
Don Cheadle time get extra black on em
Burn Hollywood burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids
I swear lifes a bitch on a period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me tell I dont give a fuck what nobody think
And my face always looking like somebody stinks
Question what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross
No matter how many lashes they couldnt beat it off
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime
Thats why its Miles Davis Kobe its Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the s
Yall forget that I got called nigga
On Twitter so many times yo I lived that
Now Im just tryna find where to raise my kids at
Cause they dont want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey realtor Im lookin for a nice park
Twelve noon she said my family gon make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listening to in this existence
Dont give up now just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away huh Something might happen
This is the making of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master Peace
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches I cant take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
Im an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didnt have the ends
I wouldnt have so many imaginary friends
Im spaced out Dogg I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we aint finna change so well never agree again
Till then Ill be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
Im spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Lets exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious gettin anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say Ive been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
Ill be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like IceT
Im not right dog Im slightly off
Im paranoid like bonin raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea thatll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you I shouldve had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
Dont let me hold you back I only hold you back
Were on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac
So fly baby my baby so high
Sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet well teach our daughter ballet
Well raise us a Beyonce maybe shell be a Halle
You wouldve been the best mom I would have been the best Ye
You see it all in my veins like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end Imma let Mos begin
You know what I figured out Im not a nice guy
I shook hands kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
Whats the cause of the poor smell
She said I just cleaned up
Baby I cant tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that god damn cucumber Bath and Body Works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score he took the charge
Oooh that shit gotta hurt
Its the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now she get her back blew out
She cant clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet Im going to sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her pen busted goddamn who brought the raccoon out
For the team
He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why He at least HooperSize
You know I scrutinize like Who this newer guy
Im my mama boyfriend Im her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasnt
Tryna get to know me homie Just kill the charm
You aint interested in me you just tryning to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces the kids of bitter splitups
And babysitters and grandparents dont know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Dont try to put me in line I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yall I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her thatd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out I aint going to sleep no time soon
And when I do Im sleeping in my mamas room
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own
Now that Im grown the tables turned around
I never thought Id ever raise another niggas child
He dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
Dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unSpike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama there
Cause when she here he be quiet when she leave he be talking again
He be wilding out be calm
I dont drink the drama or sip the DomTylerPerryon
You gonna marry my mom Look I dont read palms
And I dont read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look little man kids dont make the rules
Even though I aint raised you you your mamas angel
Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
Thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasnt bi
No I seen it in her eyes
But Im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And Im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by
With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
Told her I had a girl nah fuck it I didnt lie
Told her this rap game is alright Im just getting by
She had a lil weed and would get a lil high
And Im looking in her eyes and Im loving her vibe
Told me back in she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo back in I was just like you
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
Im like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Frees banging but shes no Rachel
Was it something I did wrong
Yeah I know Im wrong
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though man that hurt yo
But I got work though and Im at work yo
And she dont call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal Ill get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And Im trying to break the banks cherry
Tryin to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty gs to fifteen hundred in a week
No Im trying to callone ringtwo ringsseven ringseight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she dont stay here no more
I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess thats why she says she aint into guys
And focus on school fulltime to improvise
Somebody told me that Deltas brownskinned AKAs lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
First day of school Imma take you sight seein
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said I know what you about to say like your hypeman
Last year a nigga hit her and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her its frightnin but
Roll some think Ill roll some
To know some if we both honest
Who lasts yeah you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know whats mine when I see it
I know I know I know when I see it
Riding down the baby
Pacing thinking to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Dont know why but I know a sign when I see it
Yeezy Neyo the remix ayo
I think its time to hit em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny and I know its especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon question me
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Cause you my better half woman laughing
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so s
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the inch rim wheels looks so good with your inch heels
Fly that you be on
Gucci on aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system
Cause you in my soul and system
And we gon take her home with this one
I got something that you gon like
You got something that I cant fight
We got something that we both gon like
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
Its been a whole lot of hatin again
And if they hatin on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me little homey I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews Im representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talkin about Chitown
Get you a cute chick face got potential
Working with her little hips waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you but you know how Ye do
Says she love Beyonce let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain says is that HeSus
If Im unfaithful blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift they all up in
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Now is it real love I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them Ds
Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad tell by the Chloe bag
She aint no hoodrat she aint gotta prove that
I peep the McCartneys Stella got her groove back
Hold on lemme ask you why you spend your money on that shallow shit

Something thatll last you
I couldnt tell you if Halles really real
But Ima let you know soon as I get a chance to feel

On the corner
Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived he died
For his image now lets start the scrimmage
In the first quarter I sacked MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my lifes breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensationll shine through your mind
Take it line for line
Look I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around you dont speak to me
When my girl be around I see you peepin me
When they both aint around you be freakin me
We used to do it secretly now you all talk
You tellin everybody like you wanna get caught
I think my girl catchin on cause my story keep changin up
You gotta stop callin up my crib and hangin up
Truthfully if you tellin people that you doin me
Then you tellin me that you dont even wanna screw with me
And thats a shame I cant even do my thing
You get dick and you go temporarily insane
You think its a game but I dont wanna play no more
You wanna stay but you cant stay no more
You wanna be with K but that aint okay no more
You got somethin to say but you aint gotta say no more
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check they aint never where theyre supposed to be

Monica Lewinsky on the dress you take her to the cleaners
Sure enough a week later Im in extra love
And everybody know shes mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame dont get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a ena
She let it go to her head No not my Aria
The height of her shopping was writers blocking me
I couldnt get my shit out anyway I hope you die Aria
We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running but where is you going
What is you smoking man That aint potent
What is you talking man That aint important
Illuminati High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it dont matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin relaxin shootin some pool and
Playing some bball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victorias Secret show they miss me
Voices in my head I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH get out my fucking head
Its just me and my bad bitch
So you can say Im on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia Im aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I dont really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon make it thats on everything
Truest girls get half naked every spring
They saying Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday
Cause my verses got pain Chocolate Rain
So many lines you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower thats whats up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower fresh as fuck
How much they hate it very
Kiss girls like Katy Perry
I am never sprung but I Spring er Jerry
Dont try this at home results may vary
King like TI but in the Chi Larry
We killing the game its not fair
You muthafuckers stay right there

Welcome to the wonderful world
Of goldplated Earl cause
Everything I throw up blow up
Talking to the girl
She said Know what grow up you nasty
I dont understand why they trippin if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest
I admit the propane
I just spit probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now Im standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But youre here with me
Thats good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
On a scale of one to ten what do you rate yourself
Heres some champagne hydrate yourself
I know Im lookin good you lookin great yourself
I mean you shittin on these bitches you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car
My my my whips is sidebyside
He just talkin mines outside
Do you mind if I
Take you on a test
Do you have allwheel drive
And if that baby purr Im gonna baby her
Bitches gon hate and maybe worse
Cause your ice so brrr I copped you a baby fur
Just to work

Im talkin only for a night I wouldnt wife her
I got them Yeezys on my feet I got them Louies in the sto Want some
And I dropped another album fore we finished up the tour
And its still top bout fifteen weeks later
So thats a middle finger for you haters
I got my superman power my superman cape
These the last hours but superman late
The clock is ticking damn can you wait
Man will he come back and save the day
Fly across the earth put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I cant doctor and you say Im the worst
I aint have enough patients but I needed a nurse
Thatll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away then we performed CPR
With all the cars the clothes the lights the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I Pimpd My crib so I must exhibit
Shit these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly with
Louis Vuitton feathers now that some fly shit
Verbal asked me do I need a pen
Not right now
Everything I write now
I dont even write down
I dont need her right now
But Im so bad
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Since I did a song with Teriyaki I been acting very cocky
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
If you heard Ill be in Houston like Bobby
Puffing on a blunt until the B got me body
There fees in the party
Chillin in the lobbies
Anything you heard happened yo it probably did
Full Force trying to find where the Party is
For the last time to kick it like Karate Kid
Man that line was way obvious
Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
On my job kill a nigga no prob type flow
Just seen a nigga get Rob like Whoa

Niggas aint playing man it aint a fuckin game
All that frontin for the audience

Just to talk just a thought
Imma get a girl with a ass just as soft
You swear men dogs like reservoir and I was Mr Pink
Remember those nights on the kitchen sink

Now we in the streets and Im chokin you in a hood way
When the cops come what I could say

Some girlsll make you wait longer than AC Green
Passion of the Christ Year Old Virgin

Everybody saying please dont let go
I hear it over and over and over like a echo
I see it in my dreams I feel the effect though
People drowning in debt
Somebody to the rescue
Everybodys saying we need something special
Nah man we need something extra terrestrial
Outta this world speak for us
Be the vessel
Outta the box reach for it through the threshold

The crowd is open I think I know why
Im back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep Im still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldnt cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like croutons
People asking him do you have any grey poupon
With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Cant wait till they say Ye ran up at the Oscars
Poppa I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters Holla
We some true Chitown legends accept no imposters
And we standin on the couch
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
Three glasses in a row you start to think I was QTip
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips
Stumblin fallin down I aint drunk thats my new step
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel

Im fly get on a plane jet lagged already
Im tired the Goyard bags is heavy
Im fire the flow hard as a Chevy

Yall be going through problems you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep What do you think bout
If yall get a divorce
She gon take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club in the club tryna mingle
Meanwhile she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out
Ay pimp its Ye pimp

And if not
Then please keep your eye on me
These niggas is bringing out the worst side of me
When you wired me
You inspired me
To become the higher me
These execs
All want the details
How I made the world bounce like
Full messages on emails
But they hiding something like shemales
So
We still
Pull up in Sprewells
The ice and me chill
Like Goldmember I love gold
Whats the point to gain the world if you lose your soul
Now
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap white handle I got jungle fever
I went platinum
And I dont rap guns
My diamonds is whiter than Michael Jacksons
Me and Miri make music you can hold in time
So take a second to listen it may blow your mind
Ahh The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin Damn Ye snapped with this beat
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels
Haters back down gotta be that steel
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal
Look how they did DAngelo ask em how do it feel
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God dont ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please dont ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
But its quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
Im somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess its messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
Im just gon check myself in again
Yeah history in the makin Do or Die
Yeah yeah uh uh uh
Me and Do or Die got maneuvers
Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin at a chick that could of been a actress
Right now her back is layin on my mattress
Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green
Thats how I gotcha
So I you want a role model to call like Patra
Quit hollerin at them losers
And get with this shit that
Got his own business an entrepreneur

Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me now feel so sick just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked drink and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it cant be enough
Ever since I been flossin
My girls totally awesome
Girls wait to exhale
They dont breathe often
Claim that my game stone cold Steve Austin
Claim that I boss em
Basically Diana Ross em
But whos to blame for all these fights
When you aint always wrong
Im just always right
And I just always like
To see exactly how your face look
Right when I walk down that hallway right
When I pack my bags
When I got that cab
You never thought Kanye would ever got that mad
You acting like I aint the reason that you got that Jag
That you got that bag
Lets talk about amnesia

Kanye the best dressed nigga next to fags
And Im the best version of Mase next to Fab
And Imma call your best friend up just to stab
Cause of the way that you do
Mae said cmon Mike said chamone
Started up early like RavenSymon√©
Keisha KnightPull Emmanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothin handed to dude but did I complain
Every time magazines try to taint my name

Bush for sendin our fam to Iran

Lord please forgive me Im just a man
Right now Im trying to make some adjustments
Before they do me like they did Janet and Just and em
Me and my cuz and them
Trying to rap like bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I aint eva eva accept no money from these so called sponsors
They was in Benzes I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm yea that something to ponder
The money I make on this ones for Donda
Thats West to you you the next
I cant hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga
Man how did she bring it up How did she break it down
Man you at the clinic Dog slow down thats your child
But if you keep it then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
Thats when she gon tell you to beat it
You know it aint yall little secret you famous you cant go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there its hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her Man dont say that
Matter fact like Pat dont say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on pay stacks
Things come up from way way way back
I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say Im sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin to stab two like Jack the Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home he from the street
He gon want him some strippers
And Im a big tipper I dont need to be trippin
This my first Rolex it dont even be tickin
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Basically mean Im into better things
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured

I told her Im Nigerian a straight up nigga
Now is it just me or do them Uggs

Dont try to treat me like I aint famous
My apologies are you into astrology

All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas tryin to figure out since Kan came
Who the rookie of the year me or LeBron James
They say whoa dont get caught up in the hype
Aint no tellin they gon love you after tonight
Well if tonights the night pop bottles fuck models
Spend money til you broke my nigga live your life
Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch aww
Know everything but dont know shit aww
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith aww
I just turn my music up like Damn thats some cold shit aww
I mighta known her bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke
He said You lying yo why is you lying yo
Cut it out quit it G you hurting my kidineys

Shes hinting at a ring from Tiffanys
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day Ive been treating fat hoes differently
Theres only one girl on my agenda
You talking bout Brenda
Naw Im talking bout Linda from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
LaFace says she like Mase but she love Face
And I know that Linda was a hiphophead
And I know that Linda gave HipHop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She aint hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin grgreen she was like chching
Got em but she know a rreeal nigga when she spot him
So now shes pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and heres my name
Now Im sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin Cheers to you for your future years of pain
Like Dog you ready to give all this shit up
The summers on its way and these hoes doin situps
And when they see the way the G lights lit up
Youre gonna wanna have two like John Ritter
But naww I bought her a brand new BM
He said Dog slow down like Brand Nubian now
It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridgett
And get acquitted and break that bitch off cause he aint did it
Here go the Henny swig it
You know its frigid

Break out the ruler

Im tryin to give her something else to drink besides a smoothie
Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese
Now bring some more stacks
Before you ask
About the price of the tracks
The game on smash
Look

Because in fact
My freestyle hours over powers
Brothers cant hack it
Sensitive to truth and mack bitch

A l ittle bit of Ghosts style mixed with Mos style
Im versatile Im the poster child
Getting cheese so Im suppose to smile get it
We making hits like Sosa now hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell

Well our father please forgive me
Im sinner slash winner slash soul inventer
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks charge around Cnotes
So glad I aint take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
I broke up with my girl today around
My man said Lets call some girls that we know
Sometimes I wanna say Fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me not feel so sick
Just because they came over to cheer me up
Smoked drank and yeah we fucked
But nothin that they did couldve been enough
Now this weed drank got me faded
That Malibu is so underrated
She mad at me thats an understatement
I can just see your girlfriends hatin

And Ive done fucked up so bad that I cant go home

To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down
Yeah she aint got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off she wanted to take a week off
Bustin Scary Movie nuts I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge
On a too long cruise she said I aint bonin you
With them too long shoes and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So Imma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said Ye you dont love me
I told her it was good its too bad it got ugly
Listen yo
I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
Brought back the soul to change the game
Had a little beef I had to aim its stainless steel
The lyrics in my heart I cant restrain they real

She said I would if hell handle biz up in the sheets
Pop off like a thang thang

Brand new Ferraris I gotta make the donuts
CRS is like a hiphop Chris bonus
Niggas is hating on the internet I couldnt tell

To Colette to get the new shit that Paris sell
Tarantino Da Vinci getting Benjies get half off of Fendi

Hopped out the spaceship put my Mork in Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dorks offend me
Props in New York but ChiTowns the city

And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus Ross grunt
People sayin Ye we need another Yeezus Ross grunt
Lames try to tell me Cut the wildin out out

Pass me bottles champagne procession
Thats that Holy water sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message said Im too aggressive
Really Me Too aggressive
You say you wrong you wrong Im right Im right
Youre wrong we fight
Ok Im running from the light running from the day to night
Oh the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try its too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
Let it fall let it crash burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh you call upon God
We keep these Gs in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So Imma be at least about a hour late

New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said ‚Äúhey Ye‚Äù
I said ‚ÄúYes bitch‚Äù

Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls

A little teeth marks
Blood on the collar
Thats real love mmhmm ahhnah
She said uh
How could you love someone that hurt you played you spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things youre not aware of
No ones prepared for the scale of this and now you fear love
And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
State youre looking for a tour
Her allure is more couture tailormade
Til your screams in rage
I mean ahhhhh Im breaking out the damn cage aghh
Hannibal Lector my American Psycho
A iller version of Ike yo
The Thriller version of Michael
My recital is as bright as the light show up at the Eiffel
A werewolf up in Paris Im livin off your vitals

Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
Im stupid but I wont get my drama on
What Im dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk bout ‚Äúyou know who‚Äù I dont know who you talking bout
Unfortunately for the rest of yall
Im way better than the best of all
And even though they focus on just the flaws
They still gonna annihilate the festivals
And we still gonna sip Dom Perignon
And still gonna eat the filet mignon
Yeah yeah yeah Ive been known to cover up my eyes
With the Ray Beons
Flashing lights the stress of life
Its way too much to handle in one night
Live this life like theres no tomorrow
Wake up in Paris with a Russian model
Throw your hands in the sky
If anybody got five dollars in your pocket right now
I call this club Titanic
Why cause its going down
For all my young ladies ladies that driving Miss Daisy
Driving me crazy rock the beat baby
Hop up out the ERR she eat up the pavement

Dr Martin Louis the King Junior
And Imma never let the dream turn to Kruegers

Niggas done mistook me for my stylist

But we shopping in that motherfucker and they just closed
So go ahead and just pose
When she walked up out the dressing room the store just froze
And I know they tryna get they cool back
And them ghetto bitches hollin How you do that
So they could never say we never lived it
And if I see Biggie tonight I loved every minute
Martin Louie the King Jr
Starting all that stunting is gonna ruin you
If BI was alive hed probly have the tone

Will explode cause I am the shit and this is my commode
Uhoh there they go
Talkin bout how your boys clothes extratight

So I guess we should address it huh
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track I asthma attack it
Why you so mad for Why you gotta have it
Cause I slaved my whole life now Im the master

How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaananaaaaa
Tryin to get that Kobe number one over Jordan

How many liiliilicks do it take til she get to shop
Dont worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell her Girl like Doritos thats nacho cheese
Tell her friends Like Fritos Im trying to lay
I cant only have one and I aint tryin to wait
This a song with Wayne so you know its gonna melt
But you aint finna murder me like everybody else
Imma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I dont do it for my health man I do it for the belt
Man I do it to the death til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees drop the roof so the coupe dont melt

Why when were abroad we dont never hear of yall
You local retard Im the king of the world
So the king of your city by default
Niggas pullin out cash in wads

And all my niggas is big tippers
Why A little rain never hurt no strippers
And it aint like I cant get along with you
But I need you to get along while I get richer
Speakin of richer you talkin bout prior
Lets talk about now and the future which I am
All star ah Super Bowl shuffle
Suicide door ah big world tour ah
I am the menorah of this new era
And uh you are dawg whatever
Got to excuse the cockiness
But only an asshole can give you this much shit
Right about this time raise your glasses
Whats my motivation that ass is
Start a conversation like as if
You really want to know about a day in that shit
Go ahead and tell the DJ to play Swizz
So I aint gotta tell these hoes who I is
Bitches hatin again thats music to my ears
Whats you think my fuel was for all Of these years
Im inspired when people dont like me
It keep me writing so exciting
Man the drama is so enticing
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson
And just too fly a motherfucker show your chain
Throw your cash thats cake and icing
I asked her you buying
She said no just sight seeing
Maybe thats just because you aint found the right thing yeah
Lookin out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin at the mirror wondering if its the same dude
Lookin at my closet wondering if its all about clothes
Look right next to me wondering if its all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow I say I know
Then errrr away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like Hey you might like this
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin me

I took his CD and asked him what hes lookin for
He said Man I dont know Maybe a miracle
Excuse me but this verse
Has not been Russell Simmons approved uhuh
You wont see it on Runs house uhuh
You wont see it at a nuns house
My New York nigga said he heard it at sons house
Talkin bout how this ho is poor as my low is
Baby is my Lois maybe Im just bogus
Cause she dont want you to buy her a drank
Swizz said she aint got no money in the bank
And she be standin there cause its cameras
Tryin to show yo legs off you aint Amerie
If I fall in love a girl gon live on rodeo
Until that dayo she take the monorail
And I dont want no girl that will answer to ayo
Make it more harder make me put some work in
You get to flirtin play her just perfect
Fuck a drank Imma buy tha bar if ya worth it
Now I dont know what the hell this song is talkin bout
Do you
She said Yeah I been spendin all day tryin to figure that out
You too
The arms race made em raise they arm and race straight to the top
Who knew who knew
Right now they got that number one spot do you want that want that
Me too
One thing I gotta call out boy take a look at Fall Out Boy
Since they aint black when they get money they dont ball out boy
They just buy tight jeans till their nuts hang all out boy
They figure Ye dress tight so we gonna dress tighter
He dress white so we gone dress whiter
So in spite of
Anything you mightve
Seen or heard
This scene occurred
Word
How can you say Kan is so pompous
You aint been to his concerts
You just talking that nonsense
He in the same league Nas is
Or Jay is
My favorite
A lot of people say thats where Ye is
Though a freshman still the West man
One of the best man like Taye Diggs
And I was oh so patient
While niggas straight disrespectin him
So I did what they aint expect from him
Dropped The Dropout and blazed em
And aint nobody feel my pain
Until the hits that I came with
Im Kanye not Kayne
But to you Im Rick James bitch
Uh And Ill be trying to come around my girl acting like Mr
Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
Get your own I got Paris he got Nicky he tried to get em a
Clone
He said yeah you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus niece
Can I please say my peace
If yall fresh to death then Im deceased
And this one here is a heat rocks
Spit like a beat box the way the beat rocks
New version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switch my girls around like LW
Im calling
You my name is Kanye from the Rocafam
When the Glocks on jam so when we pop em scram
We showed you on champions how we get down
So dont twist your lips up like bobby brown
You got LL on your bedroom wall
Well Ill be double L trying to talk to yall
Now I aint even stay in class
To figure out RnB to get all of that
Yow cuence this girl is bad
Im getting spins all day in LA
We can go to the D where Dwele dwell
DC PG or ATL
Back in the Chi mean my life like a magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well thats XXL
Far as the penthouse yeah thats upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a Black tail
Im feeling her vibe her Body and Soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well lets kill all the parlayin and offer you a cosmopolitan
Lets jet out the club get some oxygen
Your friends claim Im a player you be lucky to keep me
But you know people gon be talking bout us weekly
My car be in a Robb Report but whats more important to me
Is that you

Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
To keep up with the same pace looking boy 'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to,
Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You're like normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to,
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God? Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You can do anything you set your mind to, man [Chorus - Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy) [Eminem - Verse 1]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
Been wanting my cake, And eat it too
And wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep and it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery (oh wee)
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm... [Chorus]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing
oh oh oh oh
Well, that's nothing
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 2]
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
Cause you never know when it could all be over
Tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way you're wandering?)
I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the... [Chorus]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing
oh oh oh oh
Well, that's nothing
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 3]
Call me crazy, but I had this vision
One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But, until then,
drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped the feeling
and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that
Straw in the gold chump I will spend
Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the... [Bridge]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
(Get along with)
Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryna)
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now) It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
To keep up with the same pace looking boy 'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to,
Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You're like normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to,
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God? Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You can do anything you set your mind to, man [Chorus - Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy) [Eminem - Verse 1]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
Been wanting my cake, And eat it too
And wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep and it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery (oh wee)
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm... [Chorus]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing
oh oh oh oh
Well, that's nothing
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 2]
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
Cause you never know when it could all be over
Tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way you're wandering?)
I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the... [Chorus]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing
oh oh oh oh
Well, that's nothing
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 3]
Call me crazy, but I had this vision
One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But, until then,
drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped the feeling
and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that
Straw in the gold chump I will spend
Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the... [Bridge]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
(Get along with)
Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryna)
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now) It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie [Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters [Eminem]
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king...
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up is using. No more excuses.
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-of-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass fusses, 'cause fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em bic's raise 'cause I came with 5'9′ but I feel like I'm 6'8″ [Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters [Royce Da 5'9"]
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meoww, ow
Classic now, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
Ya'll are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag [Bruno Mars]
You and I
Know what it's like
To be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight, we're alright
So hold up your lights
Let it shi-i-i-i-ine
Because... This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters Obie Trice
Real name no gimmicks Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,
'Round the outside, 'round the outside Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back? I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you, Debbie!" Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves, a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
"Testing attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me? Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me A-tiskit a-taskit,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
Nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly (hey!)
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerged
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me Kids! Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips, with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
I know some shits so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, copy, one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking manservant
Follow me around, and wiping my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Haha Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes
And you don't have to walk no thousand miles In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
Flip them, don't expect no help, now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
But take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid
To wait but I know to unpack his bags
Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid, Aunt Edna always told me
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably a hundred and ten percent different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you where? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you Yea, to my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes
That fit you, so put em on and wear 'em
And be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny,
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful Yeah
I know sometimes things may not
Always make sense to you right now
But hey,
What daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we were teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha) Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
"Daddy look what I made"
"Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy where's mommy?
I can't find mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself"
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream,
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "you got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby we're in Sweden
How did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy
You told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
That's what they want
They want you, Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real"
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
bring me back to life, bring me back to life,
I need (a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life) It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the crackers' ass, little crack a jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags and as I'm leavin'
I'll guarantee they scream, "Dre, don't leave us like that man!" cause I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're going to have a problem here Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Throwing her over furniture
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr Dre said
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
They got the discovery channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals,
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
But not quite me 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling,
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,
Fuck it,
Let's all stand up My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
For four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S. we should be together too My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out? My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn! Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah, yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin' Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now, ain't you momma?
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet Ha, I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause, he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye?
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show' I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen Bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet Love, love
Love, love,
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
Young Money yeah uh Ah, throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing about her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles uh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay them down, make them beg
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost,
No love found It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just (Don't hurt me)
That's right (It don't hurt me) I don need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around (Yeah)
(And you don't hurt me)
That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you, (No more)
Ha bitch you get no love
No love
No love
No love, ha
Bitch you get no love
No love
No love, and I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em I'm alive again
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen,
I'm a little bit sicker than most,
Shit's gonna get thick again, they say the
Competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom,
Look at these rappers, how I treat them so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em yeah
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute,
Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place
All the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I so started
To rock fellow, when I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride,
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent is getting no
Mercy, mark my words, ain't letting up, relentless I smell blood,
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Oh)
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just (Don't hurt me)
Yeah that's right (It don't hurt me) And I don need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah)
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around
(And you don't hurt me) That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you, (No more)
Ha bitch you get no love
No love
No love
No love, ha
Bitch you get no love
No love
No love, and I don't need you (No more)
Ha, bitch you get no (Love) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse 'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I) I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up and follow me
Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up
Look look Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
The Free World's got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf 1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 pac 2 pac 3 pac 4
4 pac 3 pac 2 pac 1
You're pac he's pac You're pac none This guy ain't no motha fuckin MC
I know everything he's got to say against me

Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun

Bitches they come, they go

Bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that
Neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride
Between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
Never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe
I know you want me baby

They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl
First thing you said
I'm not phased,
I hang around big stars all day,
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me
Ooh yeah girl run that game
Hailie Jade I love that name,
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
Rot in pieces' aw that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl 'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman 'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman We touch I feel a rush
We clutch
It isn't much but its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust its torturous,
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you and love is "evol"
Spell it backwards I'll show ya Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no ones fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mofuckin' hos
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this,
I've tried in this department but
I ain't had no luck with this,
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I gotta hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Something I wont go until you toy with my emotion so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breathe away
Your a supernova, and I'm a I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think is
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take,
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open, that I wont be makin' a mistake ('Cause I'm a) I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you So after a year and six months, no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts,
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you,
Let down my guards swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin' I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezin' til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason , I could think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you just go and just give
Before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (who?)
My name is
Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (huh?)

My name is
Slim Shady Hi! My name is (what?)
Excuse me, (my name is) (who? My name is)
Slim Shady
Can I get the attention of the class (huh my name is, what my name is)
For one second My name is (My name is Slim Shady) Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a base-head!" Uh-uh!
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off! Hi! My name is (what?)

Slim Shady My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!" Hi! My name is (huh?)
My name is (who?)
My name is

Slim Shady Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka,
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had Hi! My name is (what?)

I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing doing doing The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'mma answer
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Please, I'm a human being!
I have needs! I'm NOT done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing

Everytime I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
Doing doing doing Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Geez, I just got my seat!
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped!
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
Cause there's a puppet on my hand The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen her butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word 'pee-pee'
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Psych! I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed

Ew ew ew ew Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter,
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot,
another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You can do anything you set your mind to, man Whatever
Dre just let it run
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Ey yo this song is for anyone
Fuck it just shut up and listen Ey yo
I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags
And this bag, of this weed
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it
The stress has been eating me, recently
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!"
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull
'Cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn
And the heroin, where were the parents at?
And look at where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see
An upper class city having this happening
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And drop from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is"
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what
When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
You've been driving me crazy
I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am Shady, aftermath

Let me tell you how I made her leave with me

I ain't leavin' without you bitch
You're coming home with me
And my boy,
And his boy,
And his boy,
And his girl Ha ha, Nate Dogg My mom loves Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom My mom, my mom,
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
Oho whoa-ho,
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on val-i-um.
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank
Fucking peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So everyday I have at least three stomach aches
Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
My teacher didn't think I was going to be nothing either
What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?
Misses Mathers your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the mother fucker's been puffin' reefer
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither,
I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a tea-cup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone
I ain't playin' go find you a white crayon
And color a fuckin' zebra My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
You ate it yesterday I ain't hear no complaints did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Now just wait til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
Ya little mother fucker,
I'll make ya sit there
And make that retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put ya face in it before I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in you're gonna
Just sit there in one fuckin' place spinnin' in
Until next Thanksgiving'
And if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit you want to sit there and play innocent
A rack fell and hit me at K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? it's none of your dang business kid. My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom My mom loved Valium now all I am is a party-animal
I am what I am but I'm strong to be finished with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't want to swallow it without chewing it
I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
My Valium, my Valium
Man I never thought that I could ever be a drug addict
Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy from fucking passin it up got to me
And it's probably were I got acquainted with the taste ain't it
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom beautiful
She killed the fucking dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fucking Aspirin and say that it has a headache
Here, want a snack?
You hungry you fucking brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax.
Take it and take a nap, eat it,
But I don't need it.
Then fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
Alright ma, you win I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble hobble tumble slip drip
Then I fall in bed with a bottle of meds
And a Heath Ledger bobblehead My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom [Rabbit]
Now everybody from the 313
Put your mother fucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your mother fucking hands uplook, look Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free world's got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1Pac, 2Pac, 3Pac, 4
4Pac, 3Pac, 2Pacs, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, Yo Pac; none
This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
I know everything he's bout to say against me,
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun,
I did get jumped, by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
Don't never try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter dawg, you embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster; his real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks'
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
at his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook Fuck a beat, I go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie,
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me. These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away {lotto}

i'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow(ohhhhhhhhh) Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
(Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this) Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids? Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)
Not over this shit (Stop!)
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude) (It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute)
(Mm, I don't know!)
(Look baby)
(Damn!)
(Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?)
(Well OK) Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (Give me a kiss!)
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play (Shit!)
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh huh!)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kid")
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.
(What the fuck!)
(Grady!) Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say? (What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'm a kill you motherfucker!
Uh-ah! Temper temper! Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it
What am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at? OK
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back

No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
I done touched on everything, but little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it

All I know is when I get there

Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said save it boy
We got you on tape
Telling an old lady to "touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit

I mean girl just touch my body Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
there you go
Yeah
yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (Dreamin', of fallin, dreamin', of fallin') Let's pretend like its '98
Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (ok)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone) Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it,
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
He slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that Airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) Guess who? You miss me?

Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers

Looking like someone shrinked his outfit

I can't wait, I'm going back! Ha ha woo! Dr. Dre, 2020, yeah Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting fo
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world
Slim Shady! So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk OK, let's go Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?

My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bomb who shoots
himself in his leg with his own gun,
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl,
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck i've been through But i know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster, his real name's Clarence And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook
'Cause there no such thing as half-way crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Cranbrook Fuck a beat, i go acapella
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,
Here, tell this people something they dont know about me. Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing 'em
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'm a take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
Its unfortunate but its Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
I can not moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh,
Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your as addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away
I'm addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time I'm a
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list Fuck you hip-hop
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life Too late
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is'' dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
'Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've been against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are I was afraid to
Make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, (The time is here)
Guts over fear, (I shall not tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
And the window that was closing and there's nowhere else I can go with flows in
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than making another mothafuckin' "We Made You" uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my damn self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was gone I was afraid to
Make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, (The time is here)
Guts over fear, (I shall not tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear A shimmy shimmy go go motherfuckin' pop
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips I get all the money, pussy falls like rain
Been gettin' laid and paid, that's why I never complain
If I ain't in it for the money, I'm in it for the P
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye
Fuckin' with my 2-5 up your fuckin' ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we wanna do We're fuckin' up your city and we're fuckin' up your program
Fuckin' all your bitches, we can fuckin' give a goddamn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fuckin' planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakin'
So I'm gonna get what I got coming and the rest I'm takin' I'm shakin' like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like a motherfucker's brand new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit givin' my heart and soul
Been shinin' like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal So fuck off
Shit With my pants half hangin' off my ass and shit
Bowl filled with hash, pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom trippin' sippin' shots of Jack
'Cause the kids don't listen gettin' lots of flack I be the do wa diddy up and down you block
And the 10 Karat Kid with my triggers cockin'
The K, the I the D R O C K, motherfucker
And you still don't know me So blow me bitch, I don't rock for cancer
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
And get live with that which gets me high
Strive for perfection, this much is true
We do what we say, you say what we do Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get to much P to ever be no homo
Rock from Soho to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust, it ain't God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan, I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries And Harry Carey couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast Fuck off Yeah, right in your motherfuckin' ass bitch
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit switched we're on the same script
Nothing new since '76, Kid Rock
Yo Slim Shady, come break these motherfuckers off Yo tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathing the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise Slim Shady and Brown Trucker, another bunch of mother fuckers
Who hate the world as much as each other
And I ain't leaving this party tonight
Till I see some naked bitches dancin' around, drunk, touchin' each other Rum and Pepsi got your perception of me sketchy
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms 'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules, people that straight fool
And ever single teenager that hates school Fuck off My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
For four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S. we should be together too My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out? My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn! Mom
I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink and I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far 'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has met their grandma
Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far I want a new life
One without a cause
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Just know that I was alright
And I was not afraid to die Oh even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (who?)
My name is
Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (huh?)
My name is (what?)
My name is
Slim Shady Hi! My name is (what?)
Excuse me, (my name is) (who? My name is)
Slim Shady
Can I get the attention of the class (huh my name is, what my name is)
For one second My name is (My name is Slim Shady) Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a base-head!" Uh-uh!
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off! Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (who?)
My name is
Slim Shady

My name is
Slim Shady My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!" Hi! My name is (huh?)

Slim Shady Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka,
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had Hi! My name is (what?)

My name is
Slim Shady Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
And he said that I eyeballed him And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words 'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest This is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my Legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy First verse, uh, I'm on 'til I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn Y'all niggers intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past
So that basically resurrected my cash flow I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s
My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys
You still fly kites daily Catch me in my Mercedes
Bumpin' 'Ice, Ice, Baby', screamin' Shady 'til I die
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze And you only live it once
So I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll
(Damn) Let me tell you
What this pretty little dame's name is
'Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this Nicki Minaj but I wanna stick
(My penis in your anus)
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'
Try them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back and I am razor-sharp, baby And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause I'm on a rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim
Or statistic of this shit 'Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casin's like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics
So get this dick, I'ma live this I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now I don't really know where I'm headed
Just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die I'm livin' life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal) Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
(C'mon)
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
(Woo) I made a pact with the Devil that says, "I'll let you take me
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpses Jack Kevorkian"
(C'mon)
Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down My tenement, too many now
To send my serenity powers
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity Now was called Eminem but he threw away the candy
And ate the rapper, chewed him up and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck the mall
He shuts a whole motherfuckin' Walmart
D-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round And he came to the club tonight
With 5'9 [unverified] to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater
He's tryna d-dr-drown Shawty, when you dance
You got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' 'em dicks
Like her lips I'm agitated, aggravated To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
Then I'm have to take it And then after takin' that
I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say 'The whole rap game passed away'
On top of the affidavit Graduated from master debater
Slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson activator
(Woo) Meanin' I'm on fire off the top
Might wanna back up the data
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater Don't it make sense
These shell casin's is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader
(Homie, they spent) Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
Brung ya lay to this party, be my penis ejaculator later Tell ya boyfriend
That you just struck pay dirt
You rollin' wit' a player
You won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin' I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now I don't really know where I'm headed
Just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die I'm livin' life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal) I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people
And five I hit, ah, shit
I started a moshpit, squashed a bitch And stomped the foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin' Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon, bounce, I said, c'mon, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb to gas your town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch before she passes out Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid, 'cos the X is gone Yeah, I took 'em all down with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb
Young, dumb and fulla cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue You scary ass it was false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
So stop acting stupid, you so high
That you might wake up with a guy On some new shit, I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills and green
Big pills, mescaline
(That's ill) I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk I wanna, roll away like a Rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for coke to smoke No, oki dok
I pack up my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke Ah, poor baby
Born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
(You're crazy) I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
You got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack? We can't get jobs
'Cos our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked If you like smack then I might too
(Swift, chill)
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue
Speed, shrooms, down the Valium
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and I'm going back soon I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills I'm at a rave, looking like a slave
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy
Heroine mescaline, pencil legs wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill, bitch I'm for real
(Yeah, right) Shut your mouth, you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Bizarre nut I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno Fuck it I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin' As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down,
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did
I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it
I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it
It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks
That I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us
Strictly to show they support us
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers Lickilty Split freestyle: Check this out, Check this out, yo

Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs
Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole
She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto
Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso
Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice)
This is niether the time or the place to get macho
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the chills
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel
Like I don't think anyone's real,
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate
And which motel which lake they found her in,
And how they attacked the victim,
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like
Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,
He can give her some, she can give him some
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos eyes
Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drink anything It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berzerk) all night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) shake your body Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang bang bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow, bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel tow
Dumb it down, I don't know how (Huh-huh) how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berserk) all night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berzerk) all night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket

Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
I owe you for this one I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' "We don't love them hoes"
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker). I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on

We became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass

Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way?

Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin'' G
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it You know, you actin' like you don't know

Talk of Tony Yayo, go [Chorus] can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
and it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
but those days are gone they're just memories
and it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
but those days are gone [EMINEM] Alright,
lets pretend, marshall mathers never picked up a pen
lets pretend, things woulda been no different
pretend he procrastinated and had no motivation
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
they could blow away with the wind
marshall youre never gonna make it
makes no sense to play the game
there aint no way that you'll win
pretend he'd just stay outside all day
and play with his friends
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
and it wasnt time to move and schools werent changing again
he wasnt socially akward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
and just lazy as shit
fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
you wont amount to shit, quit day dreaming, kid
you need to get your cranium checked
you're thinking like an alien, it just aint realistic
now pretend things just make him angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didnt make it to the rap olympics
left to his plane and he missed it
he's gonna have a hard time explaining to hailey and lainey
these food stamps and this weak shit
cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
but it didnt fall on his lap so he aint even here
he pretends that .. [Chorus] can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now Aw look at daddy's baby girl

Oh God my brain is racing

See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced

And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)

Bleed! bitch bleed! bleed! So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Love the way you lie I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought
Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
If they were brown
Shady lose
Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
Look at myself!
Let's do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like "Fuck it"
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
I'm like "My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?" White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthafuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like
"I dont like this, no!"
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say fagot
Shit,
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The muthafuckin' spokesman now for White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free-ness of speech this
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you! Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you A lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you? Good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck Zoning off one joint
Stop in a limo, hop in the window
Shopping the demo with gun point
A lyricist without a clue
What year is this?
Fuck a needle here's a sword body pierce with this
Live in the muck, never giving a fuck
Give me the keys I'm drunk, and I never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips and bury your guns in the mud
I've calmed down now
I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brains gone, my souls warm, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body is still being operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writing this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I want to crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
I got your girl in my arm
And I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant fire bomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron on
And the pants to match (Here mommer try 'em on)
I get a master chick with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives (Shittin' on rappers)
'Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! I wanted a album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit!)
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bug switches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the woman fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a click, I'm a posse
Kamikaze strapping a mother fucking bomb across me
From the second I was born my momma lost me
And I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck I was born during a earthquake To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit foot so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road [Intro- talking]
{Eminem]
Shady, Aftermath
(BTOV) {nate dogg]
aye bitch, hey! There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control
hey hey Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Creek [Bobby Creek]
I'm on the patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone
Cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer
For any nigga wid Hammer
But I came here to get on goose and tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice
In your caboose
Sippin everything from white grain
To deuce juice
With nothin' to gain
But my grace and loose tooths
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too
Bobby creek is in the place
The name is snoop too
But they might been around
My drinks is 10 around
I can make her spin around
If she keep her dinner down
Simmer down
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I'll let you in ya work
Come sip on my gum drops
yeah
[Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
We bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin for a girl
That will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up [Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me [Eminem]
O' Trice! [Obie Trice]
One slug
Couldn't snuff young 'cause
Goodness gracious
Haters stay on his nuts
One just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Serious
Full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the cool blue back
With a blue new rag
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
Its true that I had a few
Obie rollin' with brews
aint that annual annually knockin' the boots
It's on manual
The way I knock em outta they shoes
Talk a little shit
Then they anus'll ooze
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Who
It's shady
You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you
In the mansion
With a magnum
With a night came to the matinee
mad as ??
Obie
Came to party
You better ask somebody [Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shaddy I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said "I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
"Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you
I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course, unless you object"
"Ahh go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head" If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! "Did you get him?" Naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything, except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah mainiac, that's Shady dog
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog
Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! Don't you know what felch means? Yeah, well then tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step father felt me
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
"Shady what the fuck you saying?" I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting
"Marshall I just love you boy, I care about your well being"
No Dad, I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me
She showed me a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
But it was X, and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
"Well this is called ass rape, and we're shooting the jail scene" If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! Got a shit-eatin' grin
Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
We're in Sin City
Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope
Diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your frigity-friends
I'm looking at your bum-stickity-bum, hun
The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack
And you can get the fickity-finger, the middle
You little dizzy bitch, eatin' spaghetti again
Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)
What are you, pit, rott, mixed?
Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then, let's lip-lock
If not then, chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like this shit's hoppin'
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this
If not then kick rocks in flip flops
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'mma keep on saying
All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't
Do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will
They saying I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertaining
I ain't stopping till be sprayed it
Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shaking
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking
What's it called again? I'm blanking
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think
I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick
then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis
chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
at least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it
quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me
(Squee!) I love it
'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off
Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway and try not to get lost
'Till we get to Las Vegas (Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
Til we get to Las Vegas Whatever happens in my room, it stays in my room like movie night like cable
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
In 7 nights in the days and it's our Vegas
We rolling circles and packs, we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving
And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store
With a about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down did an ALS challenge, huh
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sitting on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothing
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp
Weed got her so chinky eyed
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
If this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listening to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
Bitch, get the fuck out of my face
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me
I said saint, por favor
Thought I said to wait, had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
The only fear I have is of loathing
And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas (Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
Til we get to Las Vegas Yo, I can't sing good
I feel like singin'
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy Yeah, I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, 'cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look
I love my daughter more than life n' itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
Nothin' can take her from me Woo!
I told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what, daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an
Eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see, the b****'s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism The devil ain't on the level same as him
Just someone who rebels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving him an adjective an a** whooping
So bad they should put his a** in prison
I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally
Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap Cadillac from a K Car, my a** from a hole in the ground, still can't tell em apart
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a f*** I don't play!
You think you saw this basket first?
Yeah backwards like motherf***ing Bob and Silent Jay
Illest s*** you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
With a gaping hole in it
Whip out, whip down Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scalar
Being gay little faggot but by the way
Plus it's getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay It's a f***ing miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face, I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, a**aults you like an ultra violet ray
I'm sellin' hatred buffet style all the s*** you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm s***tin' on the competition
In the meantime it's always mean time I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell I've been a career a**hole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much f***ed up s***, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this s***
And I'm coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'm a snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed would have caught a flat If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it
Indigestion my suggestions's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
Its 'cause I am don't speculate spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase 'Cause baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me I think my face is melting
If you felt these migrains, see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-empty hole in my empty head
If you read my mind you can see my pain
And you could see why I'd be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game 'Cause I'm about, like a f***in' echo
Psycho on a cycle
If I hear Iko
I'm out of control like no
Other mike-o, stab you to the nightpost
Nothing but a hole inside your skull where you eye close
'Cause I'm gonna sock it to you, dyko, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike
I'm gonna blow the mike the whole night so strike up the f***in' maestro, I'm like nitro
And heigh-ho, hand me my shovel I'm libel to dig my hole deeper
It's off to H-E double hockey sticks I go I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell Oh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God
S***.
It's a girl
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a c*** in mouth and get my balls blew out
And gay into the A.M
And lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
But f*** it, suck from the tucket
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body Who is that? Where are you going? Mm come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? F*** you then
Blow it out your a** As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nighquil then I salivate
Start off with the Nighquil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate
Too a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Look at my daughters face
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Dorritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a f***in' year
And that f***er still talks to me he is all I can f***in' hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
Too have another half of gla** of wine sound asinine
Ya I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
S*** must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow what the f*** happened last night where am I
Man f*** am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
S*** half a Vicodin why can't I?
"All systems ready for take off please stand by" Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this s*** if Deshaun didn't die
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new f*** it what would Elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from two homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
That's an Ambian each nap how many Valium, three
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken four years just too put out an album B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the Nomonia thing
It was bologna was it the Methadone ya think
Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your vcr tape cases with you Ambian CR great places to hide ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know Yeah,
Ha ha, you feel that baby?
Yeah, I feel it too.
Damn.
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was am I?
Ha ha I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling,
I'm right back on 'em, with the
I can't call it
Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!
Now, it all started with my father
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
I'm as calm as the breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a
S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas? I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad

And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm so bad

Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April!
But thank you for staying April, I'm a make you learn
To appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissy face, please
Initiate phase three! Missy now service me
Take another shot of Jagger, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!
I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit you
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go,
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh! I got you caught up in the rapture
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad ya sweating
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up
Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'm a hang a sign up
Saying "Don't Disturb", shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words? I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go,
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh! I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back
What now nigga what now what
You's the projects nigga [Chorus]
One shot two shot three shot four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin' shots off You bitches is gone I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my motherfuckin' gun
(Nigga what about your wife)
Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfuckin' life
Oh shit the shoot is comin'
Bitches, hoes niggas is runnin'
People shot all over the floor
And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door
That's the sound of the glock
Even D-J House fucked around and go shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex
(Kuniva you aight)
These niggas is trippin'
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'
This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But its real and cats is gettin' killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she yellin'
(Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late [Chorus] (Nigga I been tryna call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on seven mile what the fuck was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat nigga and my tire is flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?)
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
(Shit that's the clique we beefin' wit I swear)
Man and I was on my way there
Believe me I'm leavin' a carcus today
I'm a park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my A-K ain't even tuck
I'm a meet you at the club we goin' fuck these hoes up [Chorus] I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People will still camp out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals no, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd vans
And some come walk from out the parkin' lot
Get into an argument over a parkin' spot
He's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
In St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin' all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth [Chorus] It's Friday night came to this bitch right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker
Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece [Chorus] I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"
They're all like "Oh my God it's him"
"Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem"
"I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"
"Please Marshall please let me suck your cock"
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
Roxanne
My band
My band You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!) Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band The hottest boy band in the world
D12!
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their
Underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's wan to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
(Where'd everybody go?) This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt! This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust so,
Floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mu'fucka' and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
It's survival of what? This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So take it all So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't de-fuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drive-rs
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure 'cause every ime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve! This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So it take it all Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Was because you denied seeing me
Now I'm pissed off Sit back, homie, relax
In fact grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts
Yeah Dre, sick track Perfect way to get back
Wanna hear something wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat
That's on Nick's back I'm obsessed now
Oh gee, is that supposed to be me
In the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up before I put all them phone calls out You made to my house when you was wild-n-out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out You probably think cuz it's been so long
If i had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixing our studio session
Down and sending it to mastering to make it loud Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do
Mariah, it ever occur to you that I still have pictures?
However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too
Faggot, you think I'm scared of you? You gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'mma sit and fight with you over some slut, bitch-cunt
That made me put up with her psycho-ass over 6 months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once Yeah, what you gonna say? I'm lucky?
Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base? What the fuck you tell Nick, punk?
In the second week we were dry humping
That's gotta count for something Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about
How I nutted early, 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel you're stomachs curling? Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassing me
I'm embarrassing you, and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as the song's getting airplay, I'm dissing you
I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32
This is 34 bars, we ain't even a third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you. Mariah who?
Oh, did I say "whore", Nick? I meant a liar too Like I've been goin' off on you all this time for no reason
Girl you out ya alcholic mind
Check ya wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now I'm bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an over load of fibs
I ain't saying this shit again, ho, you know what it is It's a warning shot before I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fucking thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were trying to stick two CD's in the same slot Slim Shady, Slim Shady, I love you
I love you too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say?
It's nothing
Yeah, so what I'll do
Is refresh your memory when you said, "I want you" Now should I keep going, or should we call truce?
You think you cute, right?
You bet your sweet ass I do
I'm Mary Poppins, B
And I'm Superman, mmm
Mary P., Slim Shady
Comin' at you So if you'll still be my baby girl
Then I'll still be your superhero
Oh my, Em
Yeah, I'm right here
You like this
Nope, not anymore dear It cuts like a knife when I tell you get a life
But I'm movin' on with mine
Nick, is that your wife?
Well tell her to shut her mouth, then I'll leave her alone
If she don't stick to the script, then I'mma just keep goin'
Damn I see Mary Ann. Mary Ann's saying, "Cut the tape, cut the tape"
Knife! Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread? Gotta break it
Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors I'm about getting the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rolling a seven, when I toss up the dice
I'm about getting my logo off, flooded with ice
I'm about taking a risk, that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (brrr)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like "niggas took the flow but I'm still standing too"
Thought I had the Midas touch
And then I went platinum too
Mother fuck all your comparisons
I've been talking to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America
I ain't inherit shit but a millionaire under 30
So He must be hearing shit
Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib
The D to Flint who get sick with lead
Others get the hit with the laugh
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
So you know where I came from
Born in a world going where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Wood grain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging
The pictures we been painting, my nigga
Connected to a higher power
How I know? 'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stopping like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the G.O.A.T.
While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread? gotta break it
'Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors If she was flavor I won't savor
No taste buds, hoe later
Fuck you looking at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing
I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Drumpf's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A., white Bronco like Elway
Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beatin 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
And yell, "Wait!", pleading—but screaming is pointless
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cell mate
See me I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed
Cause I'ma— Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from em, no favors
Clique too big, bread? gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? no favors (I know you feeling yourself right now
But I'm not sure she's the one
I would call them in) - "Hey, I'm outside"
What are you doing here? Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it
Too good to be true?
Have nothing, get it all but too much of it then lose it again
Did I swallow hallucinogens, 'cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't
Think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about is
Driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
'Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to
Show out on a track with me but it'd actually
Have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear them say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say (so much) for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
(Some want a champion to fall I still wonder why I laugh at 'em
'Cause why care when I'm awesome?)
Fuck what these cynics say
(Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up)
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die I want it, I'm coming to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
(And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving)
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause (They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay, they
Just grow wings and they fly, so
Hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold up and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over) Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
Nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leaving this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness
Kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain't the same
Feeling to me as killing the beat is
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger
Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot
I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever, entertain even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
(Haha) Plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon I ain't into S and M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off,
and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off,
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollerin' 'Why, God?'
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones,
so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music,
so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not) The wo-world is my punchin' bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic (I-I-I-I-Is)
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
(Ni-ni-ni) "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli) A-a-a-a-all you lil' fagots can suck it
No homo', but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
You have the same passion that I have
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
You ass dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's (high class) meets (white trash) Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon Roman!
Roman!
Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's goin' on?
They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell!
I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman
Please!
Back to bed!
Run along!
Let's go!
Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys
(Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys) When I just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit
Cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't goin' shoot you
I'm a pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You god damn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, Vrinn!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef You better kill me! I'm a be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't a said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-ha ha)
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you Bitch I'm a kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'm a conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
It ain't acid rap, I just rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth Bitch I'm a kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece!
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed will outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin' I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I go the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throat ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Til I have you at knife point, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me! Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef Ha ha ha, I'm just playin' ladies
You know, I love you
